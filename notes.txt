Attribute Directives 

- They sit on elements just like attributes. 
- Eg : ngStyle, ngColor
- Property and event binding (normal HTML attribute)
- Change the properties or element they are added to.


Structural Directives 

- They sit on elements just like attributes, but they also change the structure of the DOM.
- Eg : *ngIf, *ngFor
- leads with * (normal HTML attribute)
- Affect the whole area in the DOM



NOTE - 

You can't place more than one Structural Directives on same element i.e. *ngIf & *ngFor

In TS, private property specifier makes property of the class & assigns the value to property


Directives also have component life cycle hook. it has oninit, it doesn't have on destroy but it won't have 
onafterViewInit as directive doesn't have template


selector in directive.ts is '[]'. i.e. it is attribute in html tag
